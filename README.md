# Python
These are the projects I have coded in Python.
I started learning Python on my own through Sololearn.com and diligent note taking.
These projects are my way of practicing what I learned about Python.
Because Python was not taught to me at my school, all of the following projects are my own ideas.
These projects were not graded by a professor.
