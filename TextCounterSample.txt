This is a test to count how many words, lines, sentences, and paragraphs are contained in this program.
If this test does what it is supposed to do, that would be absolutely jazzy.

Why did I spend time creating a program such as this one you ask? Good question!

I want to get better at Python, a language I taught myself. I thought this would be a 
neat project to work on. It was supposed to only do word counts, but it does much more.


That's my favorite part of programming by far. Your program can always be better.
I haven't really learned how to make my programs more efficient, but I know
how to make a simple word counter into one that counts words, sentences, paragraphs, and 
lines!




I put a lot of crazy stuff in here, but here are the numbers I'm looking for.

This program should have 159 words, 20 lines, 6 paragraphs, and 12 sentences.
